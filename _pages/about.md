**üéâ Welcome! Hope you have a wonderful day! üçÄ**

I'm a 2nd year master student from [Department of CSE](https://cs.korea.ac.kr/cs/index.do), [Korea University](https://www.korea.ac.kr/sites/ko/index.do). My research interest includes Distributed AI, Machine Learning, Networking, and Image/ Video Compression.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Changhee Joo](https://rain.korea.ac.kr/members/professor) of [RAIN Lab.](https://rain.korea.ac.kr/) from [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.korea.ac.kr/cs/index.do), Korea University.

You can find my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6D4rBUIAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) profile.


If you have any questions, please contact me via LinkedIn or Email. =)
