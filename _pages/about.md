I'm a second year master student from [School of CSE]([https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/](https://cs.korea.ac.kr/cs/index.do)), [Korea University](https://www.korea.ac.kr/sites/ko/index.do). My research interest includes Distributed AI, Machine Learning, Networking, and Image/ Video Compression.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Changhee Joo](https://rain.korea.ac.kr/members/professor) of RAIN Lab from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://rain.korea.ac.kr/home), Korea University.
