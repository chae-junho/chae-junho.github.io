I'm a 2nd year master student from [School of CSE](https://cs.korea.ac.kr/cs/index.do), [Korea University](https://www.korea.ac.kr/sites/ko/index.do). My research interest includes Distributed AI, Machine Learning, Networking, and Image/ Video Compression.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Changhee Joo](https://rain.korea.ac.kr/members/professor) of [RAIN Lab.](https://rain.korea.ac.kr/) from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.korea.ac.kr/cs/index.do), Korea University.
